**What places, people, etc. have taken you by surprise?**

There are a few things about Warsaw that have surprised me since moving here.
The first is how vibrant the food scene has become. Warsaw used to be known for its bland Polish cuisine, but in recent years there has been an explosion of excellent international restaurants serving everything from authentic Thai to gourmet pizza. On any given night, you can find people out sampling foods from all over the globe. This diversity and quality of options is really impressive for a city this size.
Another surprise is the friendliness of Warsaw residents which has caught me off guard. As the capital of Poland, I expected Warsaw to feel more cosmopolitan and fast-paced. But people here are genuinely warm and welcoming to newcomers. It's been easy to strike up conversations on the metro or in a cafe. This open atmosphere has made settling into life in Warsaw much smoother than I anticipated.

**Have you ever been out till four? Where? When?**

No, I can't say I've ever been out till four. Getting enough quality sleep has always been a top priority for me. While I like going out with friends, I find that staying up that late really affects my energy levels and ability to focus the next day. My natural circadian rhythm seems to start winding down around midnight, so by 2am I'm usually ready to call it a night. I prefer to reserve late nights for special occasions only. Most weeknights you'll find me back home in bed by 11pm so I can wake up feeling refreshed and productive in the morning. Healthy sleep habits are important to me for both physical and mental well-being.

**What drawbacks are there to the place you live in?**

While Warsaw has many great things to offer as the capital city of Poland, there are some drawbacks as well.
One issue is air pollution, especially in the winter months. Due to the city's location in central Poland and reliance on coal heating, smog can sometimes be a problem. Public transportation, while improving, can also be congested and unreliable at times.
The cost of living has also plummeted in recent years, that's why housing prices and rents are now quite high compared to other parts of the country.
Warsaw's climate is also less than ideal, with cold, grey winters and short summers. The weather is not as mild as in other parts of Europe further south.

**What ‘scenes’ are there where you live?**

There are several scenes in Warsaw that you could be part of. For example, the Arts and Culture scene - Warsaw has a vibrant arts community. You can immerse yourself in exhi'bits at top museums like the National Museum or Centre for Contemporary Art. There are also countless live music venues, theaters, and galleries scattered throughout the city.  Or you can be a part of the expat scene - Many foreigners choose to live in Warsaw and there is a growing international community. It's easy to plug into social networks and meet people from around the world.

**Where’s a good place to settle down in your country / region? Why?**

As the capital and largest city of Poland, Warsaw has substantial economic opportunities with many jobs available in a variety of industries. The job market is large and diverse, which makes it easier to find stable employment. 
Warsaw is very well-connected, both within Poland and internationally. The city has excellent transportation links by road, rail, and air. 
With its economic opportunities, connectivity, and cultural attractions Warsaw provides a well-rounded environment for residents to settle long-term. The capital city experience has advantages that make it a good place to call home in Poland.
