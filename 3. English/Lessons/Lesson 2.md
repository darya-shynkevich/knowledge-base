**Describe the city you live in. Use vocabulary from the lesson.**

Currently, I am living in Warsaw. Warsaw is a place that is full of life, vibrant, boasting upscale boutiques and gourmet restaurants. It is a hive of activity. We are living near the business center that is called The Hive. 
I cannot say that the city is sprawling; it is rather compact with small satellite cities and quiet suburbs around it. 
An exhilarating and cosmopolitan atmosphere attracts dozens of gifted people who contribute to keep the town affluent and well-run, yet they make it chaotic and congested. 
However, some Warsaw districts are dull, where close-packed living unfortunately does not meet opulence. In my opinion, these places are typical examples of dormitory areas, with a lack of fascinating architectural decisions and modern facilities. 
I think the biggest challenges for the city inhabitants are sound and air pollution. These issues are especially thorny for city center residents. For a fancy view of skyscrapers, inhabitants of central areas have to pay with respiratory system decease, allergies, increased levels of stress, and sleep disorders. As one of these sufferers, I can say that the lack of well-maintained parks and greenery can force us to move out from the center


**An increasing number of people choose to live in big cities. Should people be encouraged to live in small towns?**

**Write your opinion and use some vocabulary from the class.**

Nowadays more and more people prefer to live in the sprawling megalopolis rather than in compact small cities. This process leads to the close-packed settlements dying out, which contributes to the congestion in big cities, destroying the sense of community and people's connection with nature, and increasing people's stress and anxiety. 

Firstly, encouraging people to live in small towns can reduce overcrowding and the load on the megalopolis infrastructure. The process of draining people from small to big cities usually increases strain on the medical care system, police forces, and fire departments. It is not a rare case when these departments remain deeply underfunded and usually crime rates in the small towns are lower.

Secondly, megalopolises are indeed hives of activity with boasting vibrant street markets, skyscrapers, upscale boutiques, and gourmet restaurants. However, small towns in rural areas also have their unique charm and advantages. They usually provide a stronger sense of community where everybody knows and helps each other; a slower pace of life and connection with nature can help with mental health, and promote a more sustainable lifestyle and overall well-being. 

Thirdly, small-town support can help local businesses blossom and attract people from other places, which will lead to more vibrant, diverse, exhilarating, and cosmopolitan communities. 

Last but not least, encouraging people to live in small towns can boost the economy in the areas outside megalopolises and reduce the disparities between urban and rural areas, leading to a more balanced and satisfied society. 

In conclusion, If the government invests more resources into small-town development, both urban and rural areas will benefit from this, yet each person is unique and should make his own decisions.
