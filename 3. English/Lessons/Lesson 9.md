While many of my childhood peers had a special soft toy or blanket that they became strongly attached to, I never formed that type of bond with any single object. Our home was filled with toys that I enjoyed playing with - cars, dolls, Lego blocks and more. But at the end of the day, all the toys would get put back in the toy box. 

I still have some of the toys preserved from back then. A polar bear family sits on a the sofa in my grandparents house, yet they don't carry any real meaning or emotional significance. Without having served as a transitional object, they're just reminders of toys I played with rather than comfort objects. 

Why do people believe in mysterious power of lucky charms?
1. The need for control. Believing in lucky charms gives people a sense that they have some control over randomness in their lives.
2. Confirmation bias. If something good happens while carrying a lucky charm, people tend to associate the charm with the good outcome. 
3. Placebo effect. Believing in luck charms can improve a person's mood and confidence through the placebo effect and acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
4. Tradition and superstition. People tend to believe in lucky charms due to traditions that were inherited from ancestors.

First thing that matter most to me is my trusty portable photo printer. It is a useful device and worth its weight in gold. It is my go-to to print some stickers / photos for my friends. I can even add some of these photos to  paper letter for my foreign friends. I hope these instant photos will serve as a part of memento for my friends.

I like candles, because aromas bring back a flood of memories. For example, the fresh cotton aroma remind me about my childhood in the countryside, sweet cinnamon buns aroma brings me back to the time when I cooked some sweets with my mom. 

My wedding ring has became a lifeline to me, because it's remind about my family no matter where I am. I think I am emotionally attached to it because it bring me back to the proposal moment. I hope this ring become our family heirloom.
