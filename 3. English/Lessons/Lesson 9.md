While many of my childhood peers had a special soft toy or blanket that they became strongly attached to, I never formed that type of bond with any single object. Our home was filled with toys that I enjoyed playing with - cars, dolls, Lego blocks and more. But at the end of the day, all the toys would get put back in the toy box. 

I still have some of the toys preserved from back then. A polar bear family sits on a the sofa in my grandparents house, yet they don't carry any real meaning or emotional significance. Without having served as a transitional object, they're just reminders of toys I played with rather than comfort objects. 



Why do people believe in mysterious power of lucky charms?
1. The need for control. Believing in lucky charms gives people a sense that they have some control over randomness in their lives.
2. Confirmation bias. If something good happens while carrying a lucky charm, people tend to associate the charm with the good outcome. 
3. Placebo effect. Believing in luck charms can improve a person's mood and confidence through the placebo effect and acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
4. Tradition and superstition. People tend to believe in lucky charms due to traditions that were inherited from ancestors.
