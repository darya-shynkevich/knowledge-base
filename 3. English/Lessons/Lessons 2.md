#### ESSAY: My mementos

While many of my childhood peers had a special soft toy or blanket that they became strongly attached to, I never formed that type of bond with any single object. Our home was filled with toys that I enjoyed playing with - cars, dolls, Lego blocks and more. But at the end of the day, all the toys would get put back in the toy box. 

I still have some of the toys preserved from back then. A polar bear family sits on a the sofa in my grandparents house, yet they don't carry any real meaning or emotional significance. Without having served as a transitional object, they're just reminders of toys I played with rather than comfort objects. 

Why do people believe in mysterious power of lucky charms?
1. The need for control. Believing in lucky charms gives people a sense that they have some control over randomness in their lives.
2. Confirmation bias. If something good happens while carrying a lucky charm, people tend to associate the charm with the good outcome. 
3. Placebo effect. Believing in luck charms can improve a person's mood and confidence through the placebo effect and acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
4. Tradition and superstition. People tend to believe in lucky charms due to traditions that were inherited from ancestors. 

![](../../_Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240211121200.png)

First thing that matter most to me is my trusty portable photo printer. It is a useful device and worth its weight in gold. It is my go-to to print some stickers / photos for my friends. I can even add some of these photos to  paper letter for my foreign friends. I hope these instant photos will serve as a part of memento for my friends.

I like candles, because aromas bring back a flood of memories. For example, the fresh cotton aroma remind me about my childhood in the countryside, sweet cinnamon buns aroma brings me back to the time when I cooked some sweets with my mom. 

My wedding ring has became a lifeline to me, because it's remind about my family no matter where I am. I think I am emotionally attached to it because it bring me back to the proposal moment. I hope this ring become our family heirloom. 


## **Lucky charms**

#### ESSAY: In the past, buildings often reflected the culture of a society but today all modern buildings look alike and cities throughout the world are becoming more and more similar. What do you think is the reason for this, and is it a good thing or a bad thing?

Nowadays, people tend to build the same buildings all over the globe, yet in the past building used to be unique to each culture. In my opinion, this is happening because of the emerging trend of prioritizing simplicity and practicality over respecting the legacy of ancestors.

Mass production has brought globalisation and has been changing our culture. However, it is unknown whether this trend is positive or not. With manufacturing flourishing, it has become easier to build standardized things, and handmade crafts have begun to go extinct. Thus have led to cheaper goods and rise in standard of living, however, at the same time, the borders of different cultures have become more blurred. Nowadays, city dwellers can easily order food from around the world and purchase anything from a katana to a burqa on Amazon. The emerging trend of simplicity and cheap mass production have squeezed into architecture as well. It is much cheaper to use standard and proven building construction methods than to try to adapt them to local culture. However, city's infestation with these workhorse buildings can diminish its appeal to tourists. The latter can dramatically change financial ecosystem of place, decreasing the stream of money from tourism sector and enhance emigration trend.

In my opinion there must be a balance between universal cheap buildings and buildings unique to the place. It's an amazing feeling as a tourist to be able to admire authentic architecture. However, we should also consider those looking to buy affordable homes. I think having unique buildings in the historical city center and affordable, modern buildings in the suburbs can be a great compromise for any city.

## **Cozy things**

**Simple pleasures and indulgences:**
- _drinking hot tea or chocolate_
- _eating comfort food_
- _listening to music_
- _wearing comfy clothes_
- _socialising with friends_
- _sitting by the fire_
- _taking long baths_
- _walking in nature_

#### Vocabulary

1. comfy
2. pleasant
3. cosy/cozy
4. snug: snug as a bug in a rug
5. homely
6. warm
7. intimate
8. welcoming

#### SPEAKING: Do you try to create cosiness and a warm ambience at home by burning candles, making a fire, adding cushions, etc.?

As a person who likes homely ambiance and spends enormous amount of money in the shops like "Home and You" and "Homla" buying cosy comforters, fluffy cushions and comfy candles, I can say that I am creating welcoming atmosphere all the time. My favourite pastime is to lay under the blanket and feel as snug as a bug in a rug. I think that surrounding yourself with intimate things can help with both physical and mental health.

#### SPEAKING: What can we do to maintain a sense of togetherness in our workplace or local community?

In nowadays world it is hard to keep up close relationship with co-workers and neighbours, yet people still necessitate the feeling of belonging to the society. Despite the fact, it can be seen as an arduous task, we can take advantage of multiple simple ideas. First of all, we can organise social events like game nights, ice skiing, or shared breakfasts where people can interact in casual settings. Secondly, we can celebrate traditions together because spending time solemnizing Chinese New Year or Christmastide, may encourage people learn about each other's lives outside work or neighbourhood "bubble". Finally, teamwork promotion can also help to maintain a sense of togetherness by boosting collaboration between people.

#### SPEAKING: Have you ever heard of the concept of hygge?

Yes, I am a little bit familiar with this term. As someone, who appreciate intimate and warm atmosphere, I believe hygge encapsulates my ideal ambiance perfectly. In my opinion, hygge is also about getting a work-life balance which I struggle to achieve. For me, this term is about warm sense of enchantment that fills the streets, snug candles, log fires and the hot chocolate with marshmallow in it. 

## **Tools**

#### Vocabulary

1. **Sellotape** is useful for temporarily sticking things together like wrapping gifts or sealing envelopes. It provides a strong yet removable adhesive (adˈhēsiv) bond.
2. **Cotton pads** are useful for applying something to the skin. They can be used as a replace to **gauze**.
3. **Cotton buds** are useful for cleaning small or hard to reach areas or applying makeup. Their compact size allows to use them in medical purposis.
4. **Scrunchies** are useful for tying up hair without creasing or damaging it like hair -pins can. Their soft fabric is gentle on hair and scalp.
5. **Shower drains** are useful for draining water from showers to keep it dry. They allow water to drain efficiently while also catching any hair to prevent clogs.
6. **Box opener**: I do not often find the need to use a box opener since most packages and deliveries I receive come with easy-open tabs or are not tightly sealed. Most of my online orders arrive in boxes designed for effortless opening without any cutting tools. If there is ever an exceptionally well-sealed box, I can usually open it carefully with my hands or find a pair of scissors to help instead of hunting for a box opener.
2. **Screw, screwdriver, pliers**: I do not use screws, screwdrivers or pliers very often because my husbands typically (и) take on tasks involving repair or assembling furniture. Moreover, as we live in an apartment, most repairs are handled by the building maintenance team. We also don't own much furniture that needs assembly. 
3. **Toilet plunger**: I rarely need to use a toilet plunger because my apartment's plumbing usually works well with no clogs. If there was ever a minor clog, it typically can be fixed with chemicals. I can't recall the last time any toilet I used was blocked badly enough to warrant getting a plunger involved.
#### ESSAY: Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in a modern apartment building?

Nowadays, the soaring housing prices have led to a growing number of people relying on 30-year mortgages or longer. That's why, modern generation is obligated to make vital decisions about their family's future dwelling. While traditional houses and modern apartment buildings have their respective advantages and disadvantages, this essay aims to examine them and determine which housing option is superior.  

Traditional houses offer quieter and more peaceful living environment, as they are usually a standalone property, while apartment buildings are associated with close proximity to neighbours and shared walls, potentially leading to noise and privacy concerns. Furthermore, an apartment with yard is a rare find, whereas traditional houses usually have large courts or gardens for outdoor activities. In addition, living in an old traditional house can offer a sense of charm and belonging to history.

On the other hand, modern apartment buildings have their own set of benefits. One of the primary advantage is fitted in the building amenities, such as fitness centres, swimming pools, upscale boutiques, gourmet restaurants and communal spaces, providing more comfort for the contemporary lifestyle. Moreover, some luxurious residential communities offer a day and night concierge support, so their inhabitants no longer need ancient toolboxes with screwdrivers, nuts, chisels and toilet plungers. Traditional houses, compare to modern apartment building, require from their owners to be a wizard with their hands and have high consummate skills. 

In conclusion, whereas traditional houses and modern apartment buildings offer there unique sets of benefits, in my opinion, the former is more suitable for family man, because every family member can have personal space, there is no hustle and bustle of vibrant life in modern neighbourhood and more opportunity for children to play outside.

door knobs

bench top
**wall unit**
tile
**blinds**

Cooktop and range hood. A person may decide to upgrade them because the existing appliances might be outdated and lack the person's desired features. Furthermore, renovation these elements with energy-efficient models, can be a solution to high utility bill.

Blinds, mats and wall unit. A person may have different tastes in terms of design and aesthetics. Renovating these items allows for choosing desirable colours and materials, as well as helping the new owners make a design statement. Moreover, the existing pieces of the interior might not provide the required functionality for the new owner. For example, a wall unit can be too small and demand expansion of storage space.

#### ESSAY: Describe the city you live in. Use vocabulary from the lesson.

Currently, I am living in Warsaw. Warsaw is a place that is full of life, vibrant, boasting upscale boutiques and gourmet restaurants. It is a hive of activity. We are living near the business center that is called The Hive. 
I cannot say that the city is sprawling; it is rather compact with small satellite cities and quiet suburbs around it. 
An exhilarating and cosmopolitan atmosphere attracts dozens of gifted people who contribute to keep the town affluent and well-run, yet they make it chaotic and congested. 
However, some Warsaw districts are dull, where close-packed living unfortunately does not meet opulence. In my opinion, these places are typical examples of dormitory areas, with a lack of fascinating architectural decisions and modern facilities. 
I think the biggest challenges for the city inhabitants are sound and air pollution. These issues are especially thorny for city center residents. For a fancy view of skyscrapers, inhabitants of central areas have to pay with respiratory system decease, allergies, increased levels of stress, and sleep disorders. As one of these sufferers, I can say that the lack of well-maintained parks and greenery can force us to move out from the center

#### ESSAY: An increasing number of people choose to live in big cities. Should people be encouraged to live in small towns?

Nowadays more and more people prefer to live in the sprawling megalopolis rather than in compact small cities. This process leads to the close-packed settlements dying out, which contributes to the congestion in big cities, destroying the sense of community and people's connection with nature, and increasing people's stress and anxiety. 

Firstly, encouraging people to live in small towns can reduce overcrowding and the load on the megalopolis infrastructure. The process of draining people from small to big cities usually increases strain on the medical care system, police forces, and fire departments. It is not a rare case when these departments remain deeply underfunded and usually crime rates in the small towns are lower.

Secondly, megalopolises are indeed hives of activity with boasting vibrant street markets, skyscrapers, upscale boutiques, and gourmet restaurants. However, small towns in rural areas also have their unique charm and advantages. They usually provide a stronger sense of community where everybody knows and helps each other; a slower pace of life and connection with nature can help with mental health, and promote a more sustainable lifestyle and overall well-being. 

Thirdly, small-town support can help local businesses blossom and attract people from other places, which will lead to more vibrant, diverse, exhilarating, and cosmopolitan communities. 

Last but not least, encouraging people to live in small towns can boost the economy in the areas outside megalopolises and reduce the disparities between urban and rural areas, leading to a more balanced and satisfied society. 

In conclusion, If the government invests more resources into small-town development, both urban and rural areas will benefit from this, yet each person is unique and should make his own decisions. 


#### SPEAKING: What places, people, etc. have taken you by surprise?

There are a few things about Warsaw that have surprised me since moving here.
The first is how vibrant the food scene has become. Warsaw used to be known for its bland Polish cuisine, but in recent years there has been an explosion of excellent international restaurants serving everything from authentic Thai to gourmet pizza. On any given night, you can find people out sampling foods from all over the globe. This diversity and quality of options is really impressive for a city this size.
Another surprise is the friendliness of Warsaw residents which has caught me off guard. As the capital of Poland, I expected Warsaw to feel more cosmopolitan and fast-paced. But people here are genuinely warm and welcoming to newcomers. It's been easy to strike up conversations on the metro or in a cafe. This open atmosphere has made settling into life in Warsaw much smoother than I anticipated.

#### SPEAKING: Have you ever been out till four? Where? When?

No, I can't say I've ever been out till four. Getting enough quality sleep has always been a top priority for me. While I like going out with friends, I find that staying up that late really affects my energy levels and ability to focus the next day. My natural circadian rhythm seems to start winding down around midnight, so by 2am I'm usually ready to call it a night. I prefer to reserve late nights for special occasions only. Most weeknights you'll find me back home in bed by 11pm so I can wake up feeling refreshed and productive in the morning. Healthy sleep habits are important to me for both physical and mental well-being.

#### SPEAKING: What drawbacks are there to the place you live in?

While Warsaw has many great things to offer as the capital city of Poland, there are some drawbacks as well.
One issue is air pollution, especially in the winter months. Due to the city's location in central Poland and reliance on coal heating, smog can sometimes be a problem. Public transportation, while improving, can also be congested and unreliable at times.
The cost of living has also plummeted in recent years, that's why housing prices and rents are now quite high compared to other parts of the country.
Warsaw's climate is also less than ideal, with cold, grey winters and short summers. The weather is not as mild as in other parts of Europe further south.

#### SPEAKING: What ‘scenes’ are there where you live?

There are several scenes in Warsaw that you could be part of. For example, the Arts and Culture scene - Warsaw has a vibrant arts community. You can immerse yourself in exhi'bits at top museums like the National Museum or Centre for Contemporary Art. There are also countless live music venues, theaters, and galleries scattered throughout the city.  Or you can be a part of the expat scene - Many foreigners choose to live in Warsaw and there is a growing international community. It's easy to plug into social networks and meet people from around the world.

#### SPEAKING: Where’s a good place to settle down in your country / region? Why?

As the capital and largest city of Poland, Warsaw has substantial economic opportunities with many jobs available in a variety of industries. The job market is large and diverse, which makes it easier to find stable employment. 
Warsaw is very well-connected, both within Poland and internationally. The city has excellent transportation links by road, rail, and air. 
With its economic opportunities, connectivity, and cultural attractions Warsaw provides a well-rounded environment for residents to settle long-term. The capital city experience has advantages that make it a good place to call home in Poland.

#### ESSAY: How to cultivate good habits 

Nowadays, social media is contaminated with the idea of personal growth, productivity, and thoughtful routines. This idea of a perfect life is embodied in several things like waking up at 5 am, running on the treadmill, eating only 'healthy' high-nutrition food, and so on. As a result, people literally drain themselves out in order to make it all fit, getting more and more exhausted as they struggle to meet these unrealistic expectations. In addition to this, the constant bombarding with other people's success stories of how they manage to put tedious tasks on autopilot and how they easily surpass inevitable roadblocks on their way can lead to depression and burnout. 

In my opinion, it is essential not to blindly follow trends and societal expectations, but to focus on yourself and try to just enjoy life. This can sound a bit hedonistic to some, yet a person has only one life, and wasting it on constant self-improvement does not seem a good idea to me. Furthermore, a lot of health-given activities are not so good at all: running is considered to be more dangerous than healthy for an average person, and the notion of 'healthy' food is often subjective. A Coca-Cola, for example, is used to consider junk and bad food, however, imagine a person during intensive cardio training, who can use sugar and caffeine from this beverage to gain a short-term boost of energy. 

It is essential to ask yourself why certain activities are challenging for you to turn into habits. Perhaps you genuinely dislike them, so it might be worth exploring other options. Alternatively, your physical or mental health may be hindering your ability to adopt new habits. 

In conclusion, while personal growth is valuable for every person, it is crucial to maintain a balance and prioritise self-care and genuine happiness. Rather than pushing yourself to have an utterly perfect schedule with organised time slots for activities that you force yourself to turn into habits, it is better to simply focus on yourself, your body, and your current needs. Allow yourself to engage in activities that come naturally and bring joy and fulfillment.
