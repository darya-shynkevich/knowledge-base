1. box opener: I do not often find the need to use a box opener since most packages and deliveries I receive come with easy-open tabs or are not tightly sealed. Most of my online orders arrive in boxes designed for effortless opening without any cutting tools. If there is ever an exceptionally well-sealed box, I can usually open it carefully with my hands or find a pair of scissors to help instead of hunting for a box opener.
2. screw, screwdriver, pliers: I do not use screws, screwdrivers or pliers very often because my husbands typically (и) take on tasks involving repair or assembling furniture. Moreover, as we live in an apartment, most repairs are handled by the building maintenance team. We also don't own much furniture that needs assembly. 
3. toilet plunger: I rarely need to use a toilet plunger because my apartment's plumbing usually works well with no clogs. If there was ever a minor clog, it typically can be fixed with chemicals. I can't recall the last time any toilet I used was blocked badly enough to warrant getting a plunger involved.

Cooktop and range hood. A person may decide to upgrade them because the existing appliances might be outdated and lack the person's desired features. Furthermore, renovation these elements with energy-efficient models, can be a solution to high utility bill.

Blinds, mats and wall unit. A person may have different tastes in terms of design and aesthetics. Renovating these items allows for choosing desirable colours and materials, as well as helping the new owners make a design statement. Moreover, the existing pieces of the interior might not provide the required functionality for the new owner. For example, a wall unit can be too small and demand expansion of storage space.
