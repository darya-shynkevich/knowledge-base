##### Would you prefer to live in a traditional house or in a modern apartment building?

Nowadays, the soaring housing prices have led to a growing number of people relying on 30-year mortgages or longer. That's why, modern generation is obligated to make vital decisions about their family's future dwelling. While traditional houses and modern apartment buildings have their respective advantages and disadvantages, this essay aims to examine them and determine which housing option is superior.  

Traditional houses offer quieter and more peaceful living environment, as they are usually a standalone property, while apartment buildings are associated with close proximity to neighbours and shared walls, potentially leading to noise and privacy concerns. Furthermore, an apartment with yard is a rare find, whereas traditional houses usually have large courts or gardens for outdoor activities. In addition, living in an old traditional house can offer a sense of charm and belonging to history.

On the other hand, modern apartment buildings have their own set of benefits. One of the primary advantage is fitted in the building amenities, such as fitness centres, swimming pools, upscale boutiques, gourmet restaurants and communal spaces, providing more comfort for the contemporary lifestyle. Moreover, some luxurious residential communities offer a day and night concierge support, so their inhabitants no longer need ancient toolboxes with screwdrivers, nuts, chisels and toilet plungers. Traditional houses, compare to modern apartment building, require from their owners to be a wizard with their hands and have high consummate skills. 

In conclusion, whereas traditional houses and modern apartment buildings offer there unique sets of benefits, in my opinion, the former is more suitable for family man, because every family member can have personal space, there is no hustle and bustle of vibrant life in modern neighbourhood and more opportunity for children to play outside.
