Nowadays, social media is contaminated with the idea of personal growth, productivity, and thoughtful routines. This idea of a perfect life is embodied in several things like waking up at 5 am, running on the treadmill, eating only 'healthy' high-nutrition food, and so on. As a result, people literally drain themselves out in order to make it all fit, getting more and more exhausted as they struggle to meet these unrealistic expectations. In addition to this, the constant bombarding with other people's success stories of how they manage to put tedious tasks on autopilot and how they easily surpass inevitable roadblocks on their way can lead to depression and burnout. 

In my opinion, it is essential not to blindly follow trends and societal expectations, but to focus on yourself and try to just enjoy life. This can sound a bit hedonistic to some, yet a person has only one life, and wasting it on constant self-improvement does not seem a good idea to me. Furthermore, a lot of health-given activities are not so good at all: running is considered to be more dangerous than healthy for an average person, and the notion of 'healthy' food is often subjective. A Coca-Cola, for example, is used to consider junk and bad food, however, imagine a person during intensive cardio training, who can use sugar and caffeine from this beverage to gain a short-term boost of energy. 

It is essential to ask yourself why certain activities are challenging for you to turn into habits. Perhaps you genuinely dislike them, so it might be worth exploring other options. Alternatively, your physical or mental health may be hindering your ability to adopt new habits. 

In conclusion, while personal growth is valuable for every person, it is crucial to maintain a balance and prioritise self-care and genuine happiness. Rather than pushing yourself to have an utterly perfect schedule with organised time slots for activities that you force yourself to turn into habits, it is better to simply focus on yourself, your body, and your current needs. Allow yourself to engage in activities that come naturally and bring joy and fulfillment.

3. ~~drink more water~~ 
4.  ~~visual cues ~~
5. ~~practice daily gratitude~~ 
6. ~~sunscreen ~~
7. ~~stretch~~ 
8. ~~reading ~~
9. ~~celebrate your wins~~ 
10. ~~daily visualisation of your goals and dream life~~

She tends to do meditation every day, however, I have never been interested in this activity. The same is true for practicing daily gratitude and daily visualisation of your goals and dream life, I do not see any measurable profit from these activities, that's why I do not do them, yet the author of this video seems to do this a lot. 
Unfortunately, I do not read as much as I used to because there are a lot of distractions and nowadays it is harder to concentrate on one task for a long time. 
Not seeing the benefits from daily morning physical exercise, I hardly ever practice them, despite this, the girl from the video does them regularly. 
As a rule, just like the video author, I do wear sunscreen, but I will not if it is pouring outside. 
I think every person celebrated his wins, nevertheless, I agree that it is important to commend yourself now and again even for small things. 
As the video author, I tend to create visual cues, because this can really help me not forget things.
I think I have room for improvement and I have to drink more water because I hardly ever do this.
I do know what to say about cleaning for 10 minutes daily, that's good, I think everybody cleans his cave from time to time.


The discovery of the week was a banana superfood hair mask. 

I have felt a bit anxious because this lesson was hidden, either there is prohibited content or a grammar test. I think I would like neither the former nor the latter.
