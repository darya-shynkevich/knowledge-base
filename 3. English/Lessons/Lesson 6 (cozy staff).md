**Do you try to create cosiness and a warm ambience at home by burning candles, making a fire, adding cushions, etc.?**

As a person who likes homely ambiance and spends enormous amount of money in the shops like "Home and You" and "Homla" buying cosy comforters, fluffy cushions and comfy candles, I can say that I am creating welcoming atmosphere all the time. My favourite pastime is to lay under the blanket and feel as snug as a bug in a rug. I think that surrounding yourself with intimate things can help with both physical and mental health.

**What can we do to maintain a sense of togetherness in our workplace or local community?**

In nowadays world it is hard to keep up close relationship with co-workers and neighbours, yet people still necessitate the feeling of belonging to the society. Despite the fact, it can be seen as an arduous task, we can take advantage of multiple simple ideas. First of all, we can organise social events like game nights, ice skiing, or shared breakfasts where people can interact in casual settings. Secondly, we can celebrate traditions together because spending time solemnizing Chinese New Year or Christmastide, may encourage people learn about each other's lives outside work or neighbourhood "bubble". Finally, teamwork promotion can also help to maintain a sense of togetherness by boosting collaboration between people.

**Have you ever heard of the concept of hygge?**

Yes, I am a little bit familiar with this term. As someone, who appreciate intimate and warm atmosphere, I believe hygge encapsulates my ideal ambiance perfectly. In my opinion, hygge is also about getting a work-life balance which I struggle to achieve. For me, this term is about warm sense of enchantment that fills the streets, snug candles, log fires and the hot chocolate with marshmallow in it.
