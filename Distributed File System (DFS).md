The core objective of a distributed file system is to empower users and applications to interact with and manage files just as they would on a local file system, even though the real location of these files might be on remote servers.

(+) by distributing files across multiple servers, a distributed file system bolsters fault tolerance.
(+) the distribution of files across various servers enhances availability. Even if certain servers are offline, other servers can continue to furnish data.
(+) distributed file systems can heighten performance by enabling data access from the nearest server to the requesting client.
(+) as the demand for data storage escalates, additional servers can be integrated into the distributed file system to accommodate growing requirements.
(+) files can be duplicated across multiple servers, assuring redundancy and thwarting data loss in the event of server breakdowns.
