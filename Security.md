***==Sometimes exceeded security can diminish user experience and security itself ==*** (example: force users to rotate their passwords regularly and are asked to enter them every couple of days. In this scenario users might save them in an unprotected note-taking app so they can reach for them quickly).

Banking application: security measures might lead to a complicated user experience of entering the password, typing the OTP from an SMS, taking a selfie and then entering a long passphrase only to make a submission for a small loan.

# How To?

1. Start by implementing ***layered security measures***. Just as a fortress doesn’t rely on a single wall for defense, mobile applications should have multiple layers of security protocols. There are four advanced layers of protection that all developers should make sure their app can use to protect itself from sophisticated threats.
   
   The idea with these user-focused layers is that even if users bypass or prefer not to engage with one layer (like not setting a passcode), ***other security measures will still guard the fortress***. The key is to ***ensure these layers work silently in the background, not overwhelming the user with constant prompts***.
   
   Leveraging user behavior analytics can help you to understand how a typical user interacts with the app, meaning that anomalous behaviors can be swiftly detected and dealt with. This offers ***proactive security without hindering the standard user flow***.
   
2. ***Integrating machine learning models*** is another good idea. These can help you to learn typical user patterns like login times, commonly accessed features, and typing speeds. When deviations occur - like logins from new locations or erratic typing patterns - the system can flag or challenge the activity, perhaps through additional authentication requirements.
   
   You should continue to make use of ***biometric authentication methods***, too. They’re unique to each individual and, as such, they offer a robust security layer without the hassle of remembering complex passwords.
   
   Another strategy worthy of consideration is to ***offer customization of security settings***. Empower users by allowing them to adjust the security settings to their comfort level. While the application should have default settings that ensure robust protection, customization options cater to varied user preferences and risk tolerance. When you ***offer them a choice***, users feel like they’re in control. They can set up their environment, knowing that they aren't being forced into a one-size-fits-all security protocol. This ***fosters a sense of ownership and enhances trust in the application and your business as a whole***.

3. Being ***transparent about security protocols can build user trust***. When applications openly disclose their security measures, users perceive it as a sign of openness, responsibility and maturity. This proactive approach dispels doubts and fosters a sense of reassurance and security. 
   
   Imagine an application uses AES-256 bit encryption for data protection. While many users might not understand the intricacies of this standard, being upfront about employing such high-grade encryption at the very least sends a signal that you’re committed to data security and you’re doing everything within your power to protect your end users from cyber threats. You might even explain that AES-256 offers far more possible combinations than, say, AES-128, underscoring ***your dedication to employing best-in-class security mechanisms.***
   
4. Use the ***initial onboarding process to highlight key security features***. Animated walkthroughs can simplify complex concepts like end-to-end encryption or multi-factor authentication.
   
5. Whenever a security protocol activates, such as when a suspicious login is detected or a password needs changing, guide users through the necessary steps. ***Explain the 'why' behind each action***.
   
6. ***Allow users to ask questions or raise concerns about security features***. Direct channels of communication, be it through in-app chat support or dedicated forums, can address queries and reinforce trust. Make it a two-way conversation so they feel involved.

# Examples:

1. **Signal's** claim to fame is its end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the sender and receiver can read messages. ***It doesn’t burden users with technical jargon*** but it does provide optional insights for those who are interested.
2. **Apple Pay** utilizes a method called tokenization. Instead of transmitting credit card details, it sends a one-time code. And this makes sure that actual card information never gets revealed. Moreover, transactions require biometric verification, which adds an extra layer of security. ***The process is intuitive, speedy, and offers visual feedback.***
3. **Okta** is an authentication provider which leverages two-factor authentication (2FA) services. When logging into a platform integrated with Okta, users receive a push notification to confirm their identity, thereby adding a second layer of verification. The push-based authentication approach eliminates the need for manually inputting time-sensitive codes. Users receive a notification, tap to approve, and then proceed. ***It’s an almost instantaneous process, marrying security with convenience nicely.***
4. **ProtonMail** offers encrypted email services. Emails are encrypted at the sender's side and decrypted at the receiver's end, ensuring data in transit remains private. Even ProtonMail themselves cannot access user emails due to this encryption. ProtonMail’s interface is sleek and resembles familiar email platforms. ***Advanced features like setting message expiration or sending password-protected emails are integrated smoothly without cluttering the user experience.***

# Trends

1. **Quantum Computing and Cryptography**
2. **Decentralized Systems and Blockchain**: decentralized identity solutions can provide users control over their personal data, ensuring security without compromising usability.
3. **Zero Trust Architectures**: the traditional 'trust but verify' model is making way for a ***'never trust, always verify' approach***. Zero Trust architectures, which necessitate every request to be authenticated and validated, can be adapted for mobile apps to ensure enhanced security while optimizing the user's interaction at the same time.
4. **Adaptive authentication**: Machine learning algorithms can study a user's behavior, such as typical login times, geolocation, and even typing patterns. By understanding what 'normal' behavior looks like, the system can challenge or prompt users only when anomalies occur. This offers a nice blend of security and unobtrusive user experience.
5. **Natural language processing for user queries**: NLP can be integrated into apps to allow users to voice their security or usability concerns. Imagine a scenario where a user could simply ask, "Is my data encrypted?" and the app provides an immediate, comprehensible response, bridging the knowledge gap and fostering trust.
6. **Personalized user experiences**: With machine learning, apps can tailor the user experience based on individual preferences and behaviors.
