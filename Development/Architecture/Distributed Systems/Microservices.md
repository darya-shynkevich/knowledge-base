# Key characteristics:

1. Each microservice has a specific job, like a chef, waiter, or cashier in a restaurant, all working perfectly in their roles.
2. Microservices can be developed and updated separately, just like different teams working on different parts of a project without creating chaos.
3. Each microservice works on its own, owning its data and responsibilities. It’s similar to different teams in a business making decisions that suit their areas best.
5. If one microservice faces an issue, the entire system doesn’t collapse. It’s like one team having a problem doesn’t bring down the entire business.
