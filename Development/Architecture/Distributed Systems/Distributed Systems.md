	1. Multiple agents
	2. Global properties
	3. Localises information
	4. Partial Failure 

*[[Fallacies of Distributed Systems]] are a set of assertions made by L Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.*

*[[Microservices]] - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are*

- *Highly maintainable and testable
- *Loosely coupled*
- *Independently deployable*
- *Organized around business capabilities*
- *Owned by a small team*

*The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.*
