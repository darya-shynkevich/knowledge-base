> ==Remember that your estimates are _estimates_====, not deadlines. (You may have to remind others about this.) Estimates are subject to change as you learn more. As you get closer to the end of a project, the estimate should get more accurate (i.e. be closer to the ==_actual_ outcome).==

1. **Understand what’s being asked**
2. **Build a model of the system** (diagramming)
3. **Break the model into components**
4. **Identify the components with the biggest risks** : these risks might be “unknowns” but often hide behind “assumptions” about your understanding of the rest of the system. It’s important to label these assumptions.
5. **Make an estimate based on available information, and always gut-check it**
6. **Pick the right units**
7. **Stubbornly defend your estimates** : You’re not doing anyone favors by being wishy-washy with your estimates. Give a good estimate and stick to it.
8. **Monitor progress against your estimate** : review and adjust your estimates as you go along. Iterate your estimates along with the project.
9.
