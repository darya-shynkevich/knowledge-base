> The main concern is when databases fall into the wrong hands. make it impossible to get back the original text.

**Why not use encryption but [hashing](5.%20Hashing.md)?**
- ==The key difference lies in reversibility. Encryption is a reversible process, meaning that with the right key, the original plaintext password can be recovered. This poses a security risk, even if encryption keys are securely managed.==
- Additionally, managing encryption keys, such as building a key chain, can incur significant costs and complexity.

**Why need salt?**
- Salt serves to add randomness to each hashed password, making it computationally expensive for attackers to crack passwords using precomputed tables like **[rainbow tables](5.%20Hashing.md)**.
- Without salt, attackers could efficiently guess passwords by comparing hash values against a large database of precomputed hashes.
- Additionally, salt must be unique per password, not just per user. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different due to the unique salt, preventing attackers from easily identifying duplicate passwords.

**Why md5 (or sha1) can not be used in password value hash?**

=> Weak hash collision resistance

- md5 has been proven [weak hash collision resistance in 2004](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199.pdf)
- The same [happened to sha1 in 2005](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/08/new_cryptanalyt.html) and [announced by Google in 2017](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html).

How about we use md5 for other purposes? like fingerprint or checksum? no. it is proven, that 2 different files can be generated with the same md5; if used for checksum, crc32 has a much faster performance.

=> - there are no used cases for md5, you should never use it.
