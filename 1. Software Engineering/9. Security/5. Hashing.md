Hashing is not just used in password value, there are [different use cases](https://iorilan.medium.com/comparison-of-all-hashing-algorithms-88eda61f064a):
1. **Data integrity** (e.g., SHA3): Hashing algorithms like SHA3 are commonly used to fingerprint files, ensuring their integrity remains intact. These algorithms need to ***strike a balance between speed and hash collision resistance***. While SHA3 offers good collision resistance, it also maintains reasonable performance for file fingerprinting tasks.
2. **Checksum** (e.g., CRC32): When speed is of utmost importance, as in verifying data integrity during network transfers, algorithms like CRC32 excel. CRC32 is often used to quickly identify if a file has been modified during transmission, ***prioritizing efficiency over collision resistance***.
3. **Key generation** (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2): For securely storing passwords or generating cryptographic keys, specialized key derivation functions (KDFs) like Argon2, bcrypt, or PBKDF2 are preferred. These algorithms intentionally introduce a ***“slow” hashing process***, adding ***layers of computational complexity to fight against a hash collision brute-force***.

While SHA3 is suitable for tasks like [HTTPS connections](https://iorilan.medium.com/how-https-works-and-what-exactly-happened-during-a-tls-handshake-165088edbee) or [JWT token](https://iorilan.medium.com/how-does-jwt-work-is-hs256-the-best-option-6cd9463da7b3) signature generation, it lacks the necessary slowness to provide the heightened security required for password hashing.

### Why KDF matters in hashing password

KDFs play a crucial role in password hashing by ***intentionally slowing down the hashing process***. This deliberate slowdown is achieved through multiple iterations of hash value computations. While the technical details of these iterations can be complex, they essentially involve repetitive operations like shifting, inverting, and XOR-ing the hash values, performed over thousands of rounds.

The primary goals of using KDFs in passwords are:
1. Slowing down the process: By introducing computational overhead, KDFs make it significantly ***harder for attackers to brute-force passwords***. The increased time and computational resources required to compute hash values act as a deterrent against rapid dictionary or rainbow table attacks.
2. Resource consumption: KDFs also consume significant CPU and memory resources during the hashing process. This ***resource-intensive nature further impedes attackers***, as they must invest substantial computational power and time to crack hashed passwords.
