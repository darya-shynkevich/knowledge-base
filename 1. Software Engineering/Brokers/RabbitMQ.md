RabbitMQ serves as a widely adopted message broker that employs the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It supports various messaging patterns, encompassing point-to-point and publish-subscribe models. Messages are directed to exchanges and subsequently routed to queues based on routing keys. Consumers can then retrieve messages from these queues. RabbitMQ encompasses features like message acknowledgment, priority queues, and adaptable routing, positioning it well for scenarios demanding task distribution, event-driven architectures, and inter-service communication.
