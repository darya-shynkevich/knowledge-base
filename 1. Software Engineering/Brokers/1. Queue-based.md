1. in theory, should have less latency because of using fast queuing protocols, like AMQP. In practice, the difference is not that big as modern log-based brokers use powerful cache systems and don’t fall behind significantly
2. allow to build more flexible messaging topologies, which can be used for complex message routing or prioritization

An event, once produced, should be available for several consumers. Thus the concept of topics is used in most queue-based brokers (in RabbitMQ they are called exchanges).

The producer sends a message to the topic, and only from there, the message is distributed to the queues. The implementation of this process may vary, for example in RabbitMQ the topic (exchange) is just a routing rule, defining in which queues should the message be put.

The most popular queue-based brokers are [RabbitMQ](RabbitMQ.md), ZeroMQ, ActiveMQ, Amazon SQS or even Redis PubSub, even though it’s not a message broker
