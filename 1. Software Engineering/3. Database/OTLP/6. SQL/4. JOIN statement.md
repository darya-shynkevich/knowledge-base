```sql
Table A    Table B
-          -
1          3
2          4
3          5

**CARTESIAN JOIN**: returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.

This does not have an `ON` clause and simply returns every combination of rows from the two tables.

```SQL
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN B
```

**INNER JOIN**: returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
 %% // Evaluate the condition in the "ON" clause for all rows in the cross join result. If true return the joined row. Otherwise discard it. %%

```sql
select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;

a | b
--+--
3 | 3
4 | 4
```

**LEFT OUTER JOIN**: returns all rows from the left table (after FROM), even if there are no matches in the right table.
%% Same as inner join then for any rows in the left table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the right table columns. %%

```sql
select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);

a |  b
--+-----
1 | null
2 | null
3 |    3
4 |    4
```

**RIGHT OUTER JOIN**: returns all rows from the right table (after FROM), even if there are no matches in the left table.
%% Same as inner join then for any rows in the right table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the left table columns. %%

```sql
select * from a RIGHT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a(+) = b.b;

a    |  b
-----+----
3    |  3
4    |  4
null |  5
null |  6
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**: combines the results of both left and right outer joins.
%% Same as inner join then preserve left non matched rows as in left outer join and right non matching rows as per right outer join. %%

```sql
select * from a FULL OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;

 a   |  b
-----+-----
   1 | null
   2 | null
   3 |    3
   4 |    4
null |    6
null |    5
```

The joined table will contain all records from both the tables and fill in NULLs for missing matches on either side.

**SELF JOIN**: joins a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.
