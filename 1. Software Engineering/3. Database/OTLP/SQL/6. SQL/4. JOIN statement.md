In SQL, joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

```sql
Table A    Table B
-          -
1          3
2          4
3          5
4          6
```

**CARTESIAN JOIN**: returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.

This does not have an `ON` clause and simply returns every combination of rows from the two tables.

```SQL
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN B
```

**INNER JOIN**: returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
 %% // Evaluate the condition in the "ON" clause for all rows in the cross join result. If true return the joined row. Otherwise discard it. %%

```sql
select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;

a | b
--+--
3 | 3
4 | 4
```

**LEFT OUTER JOIN**: returns all rows from the left table (after FROM), even if there are no matches in the right table.
%% Same as inner join then for any rows in the left table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the right table columns. %%

```sql
select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);

a |  b
--+-----
1 | null
2 | null
3 |    3
4 |    4
```

**RIGHT OUTER JOIN**: returns all rows from the right table (after FROM), even if there are no matches in the left table.
%% Same as inner join then for any rows in the right table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the left table columns. %%

```sql
select * from a RIGHT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a(+) = b.b;

a    |  b
-----+----
3    |  3
4    |  4
null |  5
null |  6
```

**FULL OUTER JOIN**: combines the results of both left and right outer joins.
%% Same as inner join then preserve left non matched rows as in left outer join and right non matching rows as per right outer join. %%

```sql
select * from a FULL OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;

 a   |  b
-----+-----
   1 | null
   2 | null
   3 |    3
   4 |    4
null |    6
null |    5
```

The joined table will contain all records from both the tables and fill in NULLs for missing matches on either side.

**SELF JOIN**: joins a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

### `JOIN` Types

In general, we should look at the number of scanned rows. As long as not a lot of rows are scanned, it doesn’t matter if it is `range`, `index_merge`, or `index`. As long as it is not ‘ALL’, it should be fine.

1. **`const`** - the best type, used when the query can access a single row in a table. This happens when the join uses a primary key or a unique index. The performance is very fast. **good for performance**
2. **`eq_ref`** - similar to `const`, this join type is used when all parts of a primary key or unique index are used by the join, and each index lookup returns at most one row. **good for performance**
3. **`ref`** - used when the join uses a non-unique index or a non-primary key. It’s efficient but not as fast as `const` or `eq_ref`. **good for performance**
4. **`range`** - used when a key part is compared to a range of values (like with `BETWEEN` or `>`). This can be slower, depending on the range and the size of the dataset. **depend on the data size and query conditions**
5. `index` - a full index scan, which is less efficient than the above but still better than a full table scan. **depend on the data size and query conditions**
6. **`index_merge`** - the `INDEX_MERGE` join type is used when MySQL can combine multiple indexes to satisfy a query condition. Instead of using a single index, MySQL performs an index merge, which allows it to use multiple indexes and combine their results. This can be efficient in certain scenarios but is typically slower than using a single, well-chosen index. **depend on the data size and query conditions**
7. **`ALL**`** - the worst-case scenario where a full table scan is performed. This is usually an indication that the query or the indexes need optimization. **should be avoided if possible**
8. **`FULLTEXT`**: The `FULLTEXT` join type is used when performing full-text searches in MySQL. Full-text indexes are specialized indexes that allow for fast searching of text data, but they have limitations. When a query uses a `FULLTEXT` index, other indexes on the table are generally ignored, which can lead to inefficiencies if not used carefully. Full-text search is powerful for specific use cases but is often better handled by **dedicated search engines** like Elasticsearch or Solr, especially in larger systems.
