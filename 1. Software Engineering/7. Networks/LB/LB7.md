Layer 7 load balancers are based on the data of application layer protocols. It’s possible to make application-aware forwarding decisions based on HTTP headers, URLs, cookies, and other application-specific data—for example, user ID. 
Apart from performing TLS termination, these LBs can take responsibilities like rate limiting users, HTTP routing, and header rewriting.
