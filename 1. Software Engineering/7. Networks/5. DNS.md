The Domain Name System (DNS) is a component of the Internet infrastructure that plays the role of translating human-friendly domain names, like “[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)," into machine-readable IP addresses, such as “192.168.1.1.” 

When you enter a domain name into your web browser’s address bar, the DNS system takes over to find the corresponding IP address for the requested domain. This is essential because computers communicate with each other using IP addresses, and the DNS system facilitates the translation between the domain names that humans use and the IP addresses that computers understand.

The DNS resolution process involves several steps, and it happens “behind the scenes” as you interact with the web.

1. You enter a domain name (e.g., [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) into your web browser.
2. Your computer sends a query, known as a recursive DNS query, to a **DNS resolver**.
3. The **DNS resolve**r is like a librarian who helps find a specific book (IP address) in a library. It checks its cache for previously resolved addresses and, if not found, *forwards the query to other DNS servers*. The DNS resolver uses *UPD protocol with a special tag to link request and response*.
4. The query progresses through a series of DNS servers in a hierarchical manner:
	- **Root nameserver:** The first step in the process, similar to an index in a library. It points to more specific locations. To retrieve IP address of '.com', '..org' root domains.
	- **Top-level domain (TLD) nameserver:** Further narrows the search by handling specific domain extensions like “.com,” “.org,” etc.
	- **Authoritative nameserver:** The final step, where the IP address for the requested domain is found and returned to the DNS resolver.
5. The DNS resolver caches the IP address, so future requests for the same domain can be resolved more quickly.
6. The DNS resolver returns the IP address to your computer, which then uses it to establish a connection with the target server and load the requested content

### Iterative versus recursive query resolution

There are two ways to perform a DNS query:

1. **Iterative:** The local server requests the root, TLD, and the authoritative servers for the IP address.
2. **Recursive:** The end user requests the local server. The local server further requests the root DNS name servers. The root name servers forward the requests to other name servers.

In the following illustration (on the left), DNS query resolution is iterative from the perspective of the local/ISP server:

> Typically, an iterative query is preferred to reduce query load on DNS infrastructure.

## Caching

! DNS uses caching at different layers to reduce request latency for the user. Caching plays an important role in reducing the burden on DNS infrastructure because it has to cater to the queries of the entire Internet.

> The local server or ISP DNS resolver can cache the IP addresses of TLD servers or authoritative servers and avoid requesting the root-level server.

# How my computer knows about DNS resolver?

End users’ operating systems have configuration files (`/etc/resolv.conf` in Linux) with the DNS resolvers’ IP addresses, which in turn obtain all information for them. (Often, DHCP provides the default DNS resolver IP address along with other configurations.) The end-systems request DNS resolves for any DNS queries. DNS resolvers have special software installed to resolve queries through the DNS infrastructure. The root server’s IP addresses are within the special software. Typically, the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software is used on DNS resolvers. The [InterNIC](https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root) maintains the updated list of 13 root servers.

So, we break the chicken-and-egg problem by seeding each resolver with prior knowledge of root DNS servers (whose IPs rarely change)
