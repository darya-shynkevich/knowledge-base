## Props and cons

(+) early on, simpler and faster development
(+) performant
(+) fewer cross-functional concerns, and if there are easier to grok them.  
    
(-) as complexity and size increase, so does the agility of the said system
(-) larger systems changes become more complex.

# Modular Monoliths

**Modular Monolith** -  ***monolithic architecture where the application is divided into loosely coupled modules***. Each module focuses on a distinct concern, ensuring separation of concerns. 

To achieve this [Conformist Pattern](../../../21.%20OOAD/DDD/Conformist%20Pattern.md) can be used.
