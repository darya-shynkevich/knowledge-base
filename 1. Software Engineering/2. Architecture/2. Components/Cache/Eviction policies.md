One of the main reasons caches perform fast is that theyâ€™re small. Small caches mean limited storage capacity. Therefore, we need an eviction mechanism to remove less frequently accessed data from the cache.

Several well-known strategies are used to evict data from the cache. The most well-known strategies include the following:

- Least recently used (LRU)
- Most recently used (MRU)
- Least frequently used (LFU)
- Most frequently used (MFU)

Other strategies like first in, first out (FIFO) also exist. The choice of each of these algorithms depends on the system the cache is being developed for.
