A **distributed cache** is a caching system where multiple cache servers coordinate to store frequently accessed data. Distributed caches are needed in environments where a single cache server isn’t enough to store all the data. At the same time, it’s scalable and guarantees a higher degree of availability.

(+) minimize user-perceived latency by precalculating results and storing frequently accessed data.
(+) pre-generate expensive queries from the database.
(+) store user session data temporarily.
(+) serve data from temporary storage even if the data store is down temporarily.
(+) reduce network costs by serving data from local resources.

# Why distributed cache?

When the size of data required in the cache increases, storing the entire data in one system is impractical:
- It can be a potential single point of failure (SPOF).
- A system is designed in layers, and each layer should have its caching mechanism to ensure the decoupling of sensitive data from different layers.
- Caching at different locations helps reduce the serving latency at that layer.
