[Monitoring](Monitoring.md) helps in analysing such complex infrastructure where something is constantly failing. Monitoring distributed systems entails gathering, interpreting, and displaying data about the interactions between processes that are running at the same time. It assists in debugging, testing, performance evaluation, and having a birdâ€™s-eye view over multiple services.

To avoid cascading failures, monitoring can play a vital role with early warnings or steering us to the root cause of faults.

! Having a monitoring system reduces operational costs and encourages an automated way to detect failures.
