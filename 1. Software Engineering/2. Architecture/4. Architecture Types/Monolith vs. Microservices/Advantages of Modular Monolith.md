==(+)== **Separation of Concerns:** Within a modular monolith, we can achieve a high degree of separation. *Each module addresses a particular business concern*
==(+)== **Simplified Communication**: Microservices inherently rely on network communication. *Modules in a monolith, on the other hand, communicate internally.*
==(+)==) **Data Store Independence:** Each module should ideally have its dedicated data store, ensuring data integrity and reducing the chances of data corruption. (But hopefully that’s always a given when taking a microservices approach!)
==(+)== **Operational Complexity and Cost**: Operating microservices demands robust DevOps practices. Each microservice may require its deployment pipeline, scaling strategy, and monitoring tools. While tools like Kubernetes have made orchestration easier, the initial setup and ongoing maintenance add complexity. This not only requires skilled manpower but can also escalate operational costs. *On the contrary, a modular monolith can be deployed as a single unit, reducing the need for intricate orchestration and potentially reducing hosting and operational expenses.*
==(+)== **GitOps Overhead:** promotes using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. While this ***provides enhanced traceability and facilitates automation***, it introduces another dimension of complexity when used with microservices. ***Each service, with its own deployment pipeline, combined with GitOps practices, can sometimes overshadow the core business logic we intend to address***. *In contrast, managing GitOps for a modular monolith can be substantially more straightforward, as you’re essentially handling a single, cohesive unit.*
