Distributed Systems:
	1. Multiple agents
	2. Global properties
	3. Localises information
	4. Partial Failure 

*[Fallacies of Distributed Systems](Fallacies%20of%20Distributed%20Systems.md) are a set of assertions made by L Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.*

*[Microservices](Monolith%20vs.%20Microservices/Microservices.md) - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are*

- *Highly maintainable and testable
- *Loosely coupled*
- *Independently deployable*
- *Organized around business capabilities*
- *Owned by a small team*

*The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.*

1. [DNS](../../7.%20Networks/DNS.md) - translates human-friendly domain names, like “[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)," into machine-readable IP addresses, such as “192.168.1.1.”
2. [Load Balancer](../../7.%20Networks/Load%20Balancer.md) -  is a network device or software application that is used to evenly distribute incoming network traffic among multiple servers.
3. [API Gateway](1.%20Concepts/API%20Gateway.md) -  an intermediary between external clients and the backend services or microservices within an application
4. [CDN](../../7.%20Networks/CDN.md) - caches content close to end users
5. [Proxy](../../7.%20Networks/Proxy.md) - functions as an intermediary between client computers and the internet
6. [Cache](2.%20Components/Cache/Cache.md) - is a high-speed storage layer situated between an application and an original data source, such as a database, file system, or remote network service.
7. [Partitioning Strategies](../../3.%20Database/Distributing/Partitioning%20Strategies.md) - divides data within tables into smaller units called partitions.
8. [Base](../../3.%20Database/Replication/Base.md) - is a strategy employed to maintain multiple copies of a single database across different servers or locations, with the aim of enhancing data availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance.
9. [Distributed Messaging System](2.%20Components/Distributed%20Messaging%20System.md) - serves as a vital component that facilitates communication among diverse applications, services, or components located across various geographical locations.
10. [Microservices](Monolith%20vs.%20Microservices/Microservices.md) - a way of building software applications by breaking them into small, separate parts that can work together.
11. [Base](../../3.%20Database/NoSQL/Base.md) - is a non-relational database system designed to efficiently handle the storage and retrieval of unstructured or semi-structured data.
12. [_Base](../../3.%20Database/Indexes/_Base.md) - a specialized structure designed to accelerate the speed and efficiency of query operations within a database.
13. [Distributed File System (DFS)](2.%20Components/Distributed%20File%20System%20(DFS).md) - is a storage solution strategically designed to oversee and facilitate access to files and directories across numerous servers, nodes, or machines, which are often spread out across a network.
14. [Full-Text Search](../../3.%20Database/Indexes/Full-Text%20Search.md) - a powerful tool that helps users search for specific words or phrases on a website or app.
