# Key characteristics:

1. Each microservice has a specific job, like a chef, waiter, or cashier in a restaurant, all working perfectly in their roles.
2. Microservices can be developed and updated separately, just like different teams working on different parts of a project without creating chaos.
3. Each microservice works on its own, owning its data and responsibilities. It’s similar to different teams in a business making decisions that suit their areas best.
5. If one microservice faces an issue, the entire system doesn’t collapse. It’s like one team having a problem doesn’t bring down the entire business.

# Props and cons

(+) Useful for growing teams and evolving applications
(+) Ease of development and testing of the Microservices.
(+) Increased team agility

(-) [Complexity of distributed systems](../Complexity%20and%20Coupling/Complexity%20of%20distributed%20systems.md)
(-) Deployment complexity for multiple systems
(-) Operational complexity of the overall system.
