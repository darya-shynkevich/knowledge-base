1) Architect products; evolve from projects to product
2) Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements
3) Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary
4) Architect for change - leverage the "power of small"
5) Architect for build, test, deploy, and operate
6) Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on
