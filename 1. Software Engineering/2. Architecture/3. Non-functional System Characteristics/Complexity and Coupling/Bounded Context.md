In layman’s terms, a **==bounded context==** is ***a boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable***. You wouldn’t use the same rules or logic for shipping as you would for product management, would you? They are different sub-areas, each with their own concerns and complexities.

***However, sometimes entities can have the same name, but act differently in different Bounded Contexts***. Example: a system for a university. You have `Student` entities, `Course` entities, and `Professor` entities. These might all exist within a single Bounded Context - let's call it the "Academic" context. Suppose the university also has a library system. This system also has `Student` entities, but these are different from the `Students` in the "Academic" context. In the "Library" context, you're interested in tracking which books a student has borrowed or any outstanding fines. These aspects are irrelevant in the "Academic" context, where a student's courses or grades are more important. Hence, the "Library" context would be a different Bounded Context in your system.

***==Bounded Context helps prevent model pollution where one model starts to sprawl and accumulate concerns that should be handled elsewhere.==*** By providing a clear boundary, it allows you to focus on one particular context without worrying about the rules of another

It aids in ***==maintaining loose coupling between different parts of your system, which in turn makes your system more resilient to change and easier to maintain==***. If a change is needed within one Bounded Context, it is less likely to affect another. This isolation is a boon for system maintainability and evolution.
## Identifying Bounded Contexts

1. **Identify different domain models**: Look at the different models in your system. If a model has different meanings or roles in different parts of the system, it’s a good sign that you may have different Bounded Contexts.
2. **Consult with domain experts**: This can be invaluable in identifying Bounded Contexts. They understand the intricacies and the different areas of the business and can provide insights that you may overlook.
3. **Recognize organizational structures**: Often, the structure of the organization itself can hint at potential Bounded Contexts. Different teams or departments usually work on different contexts.
4. **Observe language usage**: Language is at the heart of DDD. If you notice different teams or parts of the system using different terms or defining the same terms differently, this could indicate separate Bounded Contexts.
5. ==**Map out user journeys**====: User journeys can help you understand how different parts of the system interact with each other and where boundaries might naturally exist.
