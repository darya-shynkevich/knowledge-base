A **computer cluster** is a set of computers that work together to be viewed as a single system. These systems came into existence to support workloads that needed more than one computer or to be backups in cases of failures. 

Clusters can operate as individual nodes helping spread the load, e.g., traditional web servers or intricate systems that work closely together and present a unified front in like database systems like CockroachDB and etcd.
