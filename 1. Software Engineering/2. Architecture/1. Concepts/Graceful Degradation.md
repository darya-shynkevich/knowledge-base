The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as graceful degradation. A fault-tolerant design enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system fails.  
  
For example, a service that provides recommendations might fall back to providing a default set of recommendations rather than failing completely when the recommendation engine becomes unavailable.
