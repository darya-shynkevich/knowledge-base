A group of Elasticsearch nodes can form an **Elasticsearch cluster**. When a node starts up, it initiates the **cluster formation process** by trying to **discover the master-eligible nodes**. A list of master-eligible nodes from previous cluster state information is gathered if available. The seed hosts that have been configured on the node are also added to this list before they are checked for a master-eligible node. 
If a **master-eligible node is found**, it is **sent a list of all other discovered master-eligible nodes**. The **newly discovered node**, in turn, **sends a list of all nodes it knows about**. This process is repeated for **all the nodes in the cluster**. All the nodes in a cluster should have the same `cluster.name` attribute to join and participate in a cluster.
Once sufficient master-eligible nodes have been discovered to **form a quorum**, an election process selects **the active master node**, which can then **make decisions** on cluster state and changes.
