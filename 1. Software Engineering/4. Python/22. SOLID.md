(+) reduce the tight coupling of the code, which reduces errors.
(+) reduce the code’s complexity for future use.
(+) produce more extensible, maintainable, and understandable software code.
(+) produce the code that is modular, feature specific, and is extremely testable.

## 1.  **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

*; A class should have only one reason to change*

Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of the system. 

When programmers need to add features or new behavior, they frequently integrate everything within the current class. When something needs to be changed later, due to the complexity of the code, the update process becomes extremely time consuming and tedious.

## 2. **Open Closed principle (OCP)**

 *; software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification*

One might think of OCP as inheritance, but remember that inheritance is only one of the OCP techniques. We use the interface because it is open for extension and closed for modification. Therefore, OCP is also defined as **polymorphic OCP.**

- A software system should be easy to extend without the need for modification in the existing system. For the software systems, this goal is achieved by OCP.
- The system must be divided into small components, which are arranged, so that core code is always protected from new code.

## 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

*; objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the system*

This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behaviour.  You can understand it in a way that a farmer’s son should inherit farming skills from his father and should be able to replace his father if needed.

A small violation of the substitutability of classes **can cause the system to break down**, which is why we should always be on the lookout for violations. A few benefits of the LSP are provided below:
- it avoids the generalization of concepts that may not be needed in the future.
- it makes the code maintainable and easier to upgrade.

## 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

*; клиенты не должны зависеть от методов, которые они не используют*

It goes against having fat interfaces in classes and prefers having small interfaces with a group of methods, each serving a particular purpose.

(+) helps to keep our software maintainable and robust.
(+) allows for efficient refactoring and redeployment of code

## 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

*; Ensures that the high-level modules are not dependent on low-level modules. In other words, one should depend upon abstraction and not concretion. The abstractions should not depend on details. Instead, the details should depend on abstractions.

(+) allows for the flexibility and stability of the software.
(+) allows for the reusability of the application modules.
