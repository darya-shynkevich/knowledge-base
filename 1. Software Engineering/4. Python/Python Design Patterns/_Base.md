**Design patterns** are solutions to frequently occurring real-life problems in software design. They can also be considered customisable templates that can meet the requirements of a particular design problem.

(+) provide correct and efficient solutions since they have been derived and optimized by various experienced programmers over time.
(+) generic templates that can be modified and used for solving different problems.
(+) can provide a clean and elegant solution to a large problem by avoiding repetition in the code
(+) provide a template on which the developers can build upon. This allows developers to spend less time on code structure and more on the overall quality of the solution

# Classification of Design Patterns

## [[1. Creational design patterns]]

These patterns are used to provide a mechanism for creating objects in a specific situation without revealing the creation method. The normal approach for creating an object might lead to complexities in the design of a project. These patterns allow flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a specific use case by providing control over the creation process.
## [[2. Structural design patterns]]

These patterns are concerned with class/object composition and relationships between objects. They let us add new functionalities to objects so that restructuring some parts of the system does not affect the rest. Hence, when some parts of the structure change, the entire system does not need to change.
## 3. Behavioural design patterns

These patterns are concerned with communication between dissimilar objects in a system. They streamline communication and ensure that the information is synchronized between such objects

## 4. Architectural design patterns

These patterns are used for solving architectural problems within a given context in software architecture.
