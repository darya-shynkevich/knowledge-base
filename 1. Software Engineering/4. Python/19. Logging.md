- If the information isn't useful at _all_, in any scenario, delete them entirely!
- If it helps you make sense of other logs, potentially related to an error, then these are just info logs for debugging! They should be INFO level to reflect that.
- And if it is an error you need to fix, well, it's not a warning now is it? Make that an ERROR log.

### Enhance your logs in other ways

- **Attach a request/trace id.** This goes along with distributed tracing, and helps you filter effectively.
- **Include timestamps.** All logs should include timestamps, but let's just make _sure_ we have them and at a useful precision. Having these in a structured format makes it easier to use them for calculations.
- **Add related ids.** When an incoming request relates to a given user, document, or other data, adding that id into the logs is so helpful! Then when you're debugging, you can see either all the logs for a particular object, or you can see if a particular set of data is related to the issue you're working on.
- **Flags which were set.** 
- **Where the log came from.**
