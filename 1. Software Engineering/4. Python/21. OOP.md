Objects:
1. represent entities in application during development
2. entities interact among themselves to solve real-world problems

[Classes](Classes):
1. define objects in attributes and behaviour
2. consist of constructors that provide the initial state for these objects
3. like templates for objects

Methods:
1. represent the behaviour of the objects

Encapsulation:
1. behaviour is kept hidden from the outside world / object keep it's state private
2. client can't change the object's internal state by directly acting on them 

Polymorphism:
1. an object provides different implementations of the method based on input params;
2. the same interface can be used by objects of different types.

Inheritance:
1. indicates that one class derives (most of its) functionality from the parent class
2. an option to reuse functionality
