Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a _reducer._

- **Reducers must be pure.** Similar to [state updater functions](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates), reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers [must be pure](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure)—same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update [objects](https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state) and [arrays](https://react.dev/learn/updating-arrays-in-state) without mutations.
- **Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data.** For example, if a user presses “Reset” on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one `reset_form` action rather than five separate `set_field` actions.

### Step 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions

Managing state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting state. Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “what the user just did” by dispatching “actions” from your event handlers. (The state update logic will live elsewhere!) So instead of “setting `tasks`” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent.

```js
function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {  
	dispatch(  
		// "action" object:  
		{  
			type: 'deleted',  
			id: taskId,  
		}  
	);  
}
```

It is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about _what happened_. (You will add the `dispatch` function itself in a later step.)

> By convention, it is common to give it a string `type` that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The `type` is specific to a component, so in this example either `'added'` or `'added_task'` would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened!

```js
dispatch({  
	// specific to component  
	type: 'what_happened',  
	// other fields go here  
});
```

### Step 2: Write a reducer function

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state:

```js
function yourReducer(state, action) {  
	// return next state for React to set  
}
```

```js
function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  if (action.type === 'added') {
    return [
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        done: false,
      },
    ];
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Use the reducer from your component

```js
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);
```

The `useReducer` Hook is similar to `useState`—you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function).

Component logic can be easier to read when you separate concerns like this. Now the event handlers only specify _what happened_ by dispatching actions, and the reducer function determines _how the state updates_ in response to them.

## Comparing `useState` and `useReducer`

- **Code size:** Generally, with `useState` you have to write less code upfront. With `useReducer`, you have to write both a reducer function _and_ dispatch actions. However, `useReducer` can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.
- **Readability:** `useState` is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component’s code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, `useReducer` lets you cleanly separate the _how_ of update logic from the _what happened_ of event handlers.
- **Debugging:** When you have a bug with `useState`, it can be difficult to tell _where_ the state was set incorrectly, and _why_. With `useReducer`, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and _why_ it happened (due to which `action`). If each `action` is correct, you’ll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with `useState`.
- **Testing:** A reducer is a pure function that doesn’t depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it’s best to test components in a more realistic environment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular state for a particular initial state and action.
