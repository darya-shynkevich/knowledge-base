*A **quorum** is the minimum number of votes that a distributed system has to obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operations like failover. This number is configurable, but should be reflective of the number of nodes in said distributed system. Most distributed systems have sizes of three or five with quorums of two and three respectively. Odd number of nodes is preffered in cases the system is required to break ties.*
