Python does not release all the memory back to the operating system as soon as it deletes an object:
1. An additional memory manager is used, designed for small objects (< 512 bytes)
2. *Large memory blocks* are allocated to work with *small objects*, in which *small objects* are stored
3. As soon as a *small object* is deleted, the memory does not go to the OS. Python reserves it for new objects
4. If there are no more objects in one of the allocated *large memory block* => its release to the OS

### **Garbage Collection Algorithm:**
1. Reference counting
2. Generational garbage collector

#### 1. **Reference Counting Algorithm:**

(+) Objects are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed
(-) Cyclic references
(-) Blocking threads
(-) Additional memory and CPU overhead

1. Fundamental and cannot be disabled
2. Each object in Python has an additional field (reference count)
3. The counter is increased:
   1. Assignment operator and constructions like `foo=bar`
   2. Passing an argument
   3. Inserting a new object into a list
4. As soon as the counter = 0, the process of destroying the object is launched
5. *Global variables* live as long as the Python process is alive

#### 2. Generational garbage collector

- module `gc`
- purpose: removal of cycle objects (cyclic references can only occur in container objects (lists, dictionaries, classes)) => GC does not track simple and immutable objects (except `tuple`)
- does not work in real-time, runs periodically => creates delays => CPython uses various heuristics to determine the frequency of garbage collector runs

***Generational Hypothesis:** if an object survives a particular period of time it;s expected to survive for longer. Old objects tend to stay around and new objects tend to die quickly.*

1. New objects are placed in the first generation.
2. If an object survives the garbage collection process, it is moved to the next generation.
3. The older the generation, the less frequently it is scanned.
4. Each generation has a special counter and trigger threshold: 700, 10, 10.
5. Objects either remain in the 3rd generation forever, or are deleted.

**The Tricolor Algorithm:** traversal on the program graph and look: can we reach the node or not? Example A->B->C<-D<-E; it is not possible to reach D and E => we can delete them.
	(+) no mistakes
	(-) bad performance
