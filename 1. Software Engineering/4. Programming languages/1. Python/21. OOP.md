## **Objects:**
1. represent entities in application during development
2. entities interact among themselves to solve real-world problems

## **[Classes](Classes):**
1. define objects in attributes and behaviour
2. consist of constructors that provide the initial state for these objects
3. like templates for objects

## **Methods:**
1. represent the behaviour of the objects

## **Abstraction:**
revealing the necessary details of a system and hiding irrelevant information to minimize its complexity. In simpler words, we can say that it means to show what an object does and and hides how it does it.

(+) it reduces the complexity of the system from a user's perspective.
(+) it makes the code extendable and reusable.
(+) it It refines the modularity of the application or the system.
(+) it makes the code more maintainable.

## **Encapsulation:**
1. behaviour is kept hidden from the outside world / object keep it's state private
2. client can't change the object's internal state by directly acting on them 

(+) classes are simpler to modify and maintain.
(+) which data member we wish to keep hidden or accessible can be specified.
(+) we choose which variables are read-only and write-only (increases flexibility).

## **Abstraction vs Encapsulation:**

## **Inheritance:**
1. indicates that one class derives (most of its) functionality from the parent class
2. an option to reuse functionality 

	The IS-A relationship:

		We cannot use inheritance if an IS-A relationship doesn’t exist between classes

### Types of inheritance:
1. **Single inheritance:** 
	Example: a fuel car IS-A vehicle
2. **Multiple inheritance:** 
	Example: The hybrid car IS-A fuel car, The hybrid car IS-A electric car as well.
3. **Multi-level inheritance:** when a class is derived from a class that itself is derived from another class, it is called multi-level inheritance. We can extend the classes to as many levels as we want
	Example: A fuel car IS-A vehicle, A gasoline car IS-A fuel car => gasoline car <- fuel car <- vehicle
4. **Hierarchical inheritance:** more than one class extends, as per the requirement of the design, from the same base class. The common attributes of these child classes are implemented inside the base class.
	Example: A fuel car IS-A vehicle,  An electric car IS-A vehicle

5. **Hybrid inheritance:** type of inheritance which is a combination of “multiple” and “multi-level” inheritance
	Example: A fuel car IS-A vehicle, An electric car IS-A vehicle, A hybrid car IS-A fuel car and IS-A electric car.

## **Polymorphism:**

1. an object provides different implementations of the method based on input params;
2. the same interface can be used by objects of different types.

### Types of polymorphism

![](Pasted%20image%2020240113130214.png)

1. **Dynamic** **polymorphism**: is the mechanism that defines the methods with the same name, return type, and parameters in the base class and derived classes. Hence, the call to an overridden method is decided at runtime. That is why dynamic polymorphism is also known as **runtime** **polymorphism**. It is achieved by method overriding.
	- Method overriding
2. **Static polymorphism:** is also known as compile-time polymorphism, and it is achieved by method overloading or operator overloading
	- Method overloading: methods are said to be **overloaded** if a class has more than one method with the same name, but either the number of arguments is different, or the type of arguments is different.
	- Operator overloading: **operators** can be overloaded to operate in a certain user-defined way. Its corresponding method is invoked to perform its predefined function whenever an operator is used. For example, when the `+` operator is called, it invokes the special function, `add`, but this operator acts differently for different data types.
