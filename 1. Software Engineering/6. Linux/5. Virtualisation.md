tldr; virtual machines is isolation of machines, while containers is isolation of processes.

Virtualisation splits up a computer's physical components into multiple virtual computers, **promoting isolation** and **abstraction**. It allows businesses to **run multiple applications in a single server, making more efficient use of hardware**.

Virtual machine is a software based computer. When reasoning about virtual machines its important to understand the two main components:

1. ***GuestOS***. *It's whatever operating system you are trying to run*
2. ***Hypervisor*** *are software that manages and coordinates virtual machines running on physical hardware. It manages everything from allocating resources to virtual machine isolation. Ensuring all machines have the required resources and ensuring issues with one virtual machine doesn't impact the other.* 
	   - ***Type 1 or Bare Metal Hypervisors (OpenKVM)*** *run directly on physical hardware, reducing latency and improving overall efficiency.*
	   - ***Type 2 or Host Hypervisors (VirtualBox)*** *which run as an application on top of another host operating system and often incur a performance hit due to the extra abstraction layer.*

	*Since there is a clean separation between processes on the hostOS and the guestOS, the isolation level is superior. **The trade-off here is performance and efficiency**, but a big step up from running a single process per machine.*

# Containers & Processes: What's the difference?

![](../../Pasted%20image%2020240328102117.png)

Containers - more like groups of processes coupled with some low level kernel features that allows them to be isolated as a seperate machine, but from the perspective of the host machine its just another set of processes.

The following kernel features allow for this to be a reality.
- **namespaces** which allows for the parition of kernel resources such as user namescape, process IDs, network and filesystems.
- **cgroups** which manages the grouping of processes and resources allocated to that specific grouping.
- **capabilities** which allows us to limit or extend certain superuser privileges for a specific process.

A process (or collection of processes) that has been given more isolation from the OS than a typical process is called a **container**. But at the expense of less security, as compared to a VM, of isolation.

At the level of the operating system (OS), processes typically only have separated memory space and user privileges.

**Virtual machines offer complete OS isolation**, which enables them to build a brand-new operating system on top of the host's hardware. Full isolation comes with a price: running a VM requires more resources.

Containers are a pseudo-isolated environment compared to virtual machines.
