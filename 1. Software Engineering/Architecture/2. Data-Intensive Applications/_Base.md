Many applications today are ***data-intensive***, as opposed to compute-intensive. Raw CPU power is rarely a limiting factor for these applications — bigger problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.

[[Reliability]]. The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‐ ware faults, and even human error).

[[Scalability]]. As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.

[[Maintainability]]. Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.
