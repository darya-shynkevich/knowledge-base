Distributed Systems:
	1. Multiple agents
	2. Global properties
	3. Localises information
	4. Partial Failure 

*[[Fallacies of Distributed Systems]] are a set of assertions made by L Peter Deutsch and others at Sun Microsystems describing false assumptions that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.*

*[[Microservices]] - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are*

- *Highly maintainable and testable
- *Loosely coupled*
- *Independently deployable*
- *Organized around business capabilities*
- *Owned by a small team*

*The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.*

1. [[DNS]] - translates human-friendly domain names, like “[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)," into machine-readable IP addresses, such as “192.168.1.1.”
2. [[Load Balancer]] -  is a network device or software application that is used to evenly distribute incoming network traffic among multiple servers.
3. [[API Gateway]] -  an intermediary between external clients and the backend services or microservices within an application
4. [[1. Software Engineering/Networks/CDN]] - caches content close to end users
5. [[Proxy]] - functions as an intermediary between client computers and the internet
6. [[Cache]] - is a high-speed storage layer situated between an application and an original data source, such as a database, file system, or remote network service.
7. [[Partitioning Strategies]] - divides data within tables into smaller units called partitions.
8. [[1. Software Engineering/Database/Replication/Base]] - is a strategy employed to maintain multiple copies of a single database across different servers or locations, with the aim of enhancing data availability, redundancy, and fault tolerance.
9. [[Distributed Messaging System]] - serves as a vital component that facilitates communication among diverse applications, services, or components located across various geographical locations.
10. [[Microservices]] - a way of building software applications by breaking them into small, separate parts that can work together.
11. [[1. Software Engineering/Database/NoSQL/Base]] - is a non-relational database system designed to efficiently handle the storage and retrieval of unstructured or semi-structured data.
12. [[1. Software Engineering/Database/Indexes/Base]] - a specialized structure designed to accelerate the speed and efficiency of query operations within a database.
13. [[Distributed File System (DFS)]] - is a storage solution strategically designed to oversee and facilitate access to files and directories across numerous servers, nodes, or machines, which are often spread out across a network.
14. [[Full-Text Search]] - a powerful tool that helps users search for specific words or phrases on a website or app.
