Team A is upstream and Team B is downstream. If Team A has no incentive to adapt their interface or service for Team B’s needs, Team B might end up having to ‘conform’, thereby adopting the `Conformist pattern`. The downstream team may have to make do with whatever interface or features are provided, even if they’re not optimal for their requirements.

In a modular monolith, ***internal negotiations and architecture reviews can be facilitated to address these dynamics, ensuring that teams work cohesively and don’t end up unintentionally enforcing the Conformist pattern***, leading to sub-optimal solutions.
