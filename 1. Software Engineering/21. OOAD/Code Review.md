Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.

1. Validate agreements (i.e. is there unit tests? is there documentation?).
2. Offer another pair of eyes (i.e. check for typos, identify confusing areas).
3. Ask questions when you don’t understand something and offer feedback if you’d like to change something.
4. Say no to the Pull Request if it’s either unclear or unreviewable.
5. Don’t be rude when writing comments.

A comment is marked by a keyword like `question`, `issue`, `remark`, `suggestion`, or any others that seem appropriate. This way, the code author can understand the severity of your notes and decide what definitely needs to be changed and what can stay as it is.
