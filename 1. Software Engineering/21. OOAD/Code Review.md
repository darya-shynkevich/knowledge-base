Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.

- Validate agreements (i.e. is there unit tests? is there documentation?).
- Offer another pair of eyes (i.e. check for typos, identify confusing areas).
- Ask questions when you don’t understand something and offer feedback if you’d like to change something.
- Say no to the Pull Request if it’s either unclear or unreviewable.
- Don’t be rude when writing comments.
