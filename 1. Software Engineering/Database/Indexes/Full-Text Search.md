To make this speedy search work, a special kind of structure called an “inverted index” is used. This index connects words or phrases to the documents where they appear. The index lists all the unique words in the documents and points to the documents they’re in.

[Elasticsearch](Elasticsearch) is also smart enough to handle different types of data. It can figure out new things you add and make them searchable without much trouble. This is called “dynamic mapping.” But if you want to control things more carefully, you can set up specific rules.
