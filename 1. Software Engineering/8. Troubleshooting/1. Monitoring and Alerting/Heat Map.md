We can identify if a server is down by using heat maps. Each rack of servers is named and is sorted by data center, then cluster, then row, so problems common at any of these levels are readily apparent.

A heat map depicting the operational state of a large number of components is an effective method. The health of each component is indicated by the color of each cell in a big matrix. Nodes with green cells operate within permitted parameters, while nodes with red cells are nonresponsive on multiple tries.
