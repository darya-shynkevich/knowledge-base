Stress testing **pushes your API beyond its expected limits** **to identify failure points and determine its resilience**. Increase the load gradually until you reach the breaking point, observing how the API behaves under extreme conditions. This helps uncover potential bottlenecks, resource limitations, or performance issues that may arise during peak traffic or unexpected spikes.
