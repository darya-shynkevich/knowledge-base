**Socket** is a data structure that contains multiple pieces of information necessary for network communication. Here’s a conceptual representation of socket:

```bash
Socket {  
	IP Address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (IPv4) or xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx (IPv6)  
	Port Number: xxxx  
	Protocol: TCP/UDP  
	Socket Type: Stream/Datagram  
	State: LISTEN/ESTABLISHED/UNBOUND/...  
	File Descriptor: N  
	}
```

**File Descriptor** is just an integer. When we represent a socket using a file descriptor, the operating system maintains a mapping between the socket’s file descriptor (the integer) and the actual socket data structure, which contains the IP address, port number, protocol, and other information. This mapping allows the operating system to correctly route incoming data to the appropriate socket in the application using the file descriptor.

In Linux based systems, instead of only the blocking **read()** call, we call **select()** on fd2 or a bunch of file descriptors. Only when **select()** returns ready i.e. there’s something available to read, the app calls **read()** on that file descriptor to read data. If no file descriptor is ready, the app continues to work on other tasks.
